- What's on your agenda?
- Later today, I'm going to have a short meeting with my advisor.
- After that, I guess I'll write some code and update a repository.
- But lately, I've been feeling a bit anxious about the future.
- My advisor hasn't looked over my paper in over three months.
- And the journal he want to submit it to is pretty competitive.
- Keep working hard, and things will fall into place.
- I'm planning to put in about 1000 hours of practice to improve my English.
- I figure that should be a sufficient amount of effort.
